## What is Gunter?
Aside from being the coolest penguin in the Ice Kingdom of Ooo, it is my toy 3D
rendering engine written for fun in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). Gunter is my pet
(project) with which I learn OpenGL graphics programming and hone my low-level skills
with a new and fun language: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).
